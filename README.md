# Julia from Scratch
A learning repository dedicated to the Julia Language. This is a short course for understanding basic critical data science techniques, and implementing them 'by hand' when at all possible. 

The goal is to teach elegant customized programming that scales. 

# Chapter 1: The Digital Age 
- How the Digital Age differs from prior eras, and why it makes data science skills mandatory. 
- Basic occupational definitions: Data Science, Machine Learning Engineer, Data Engineer - what are these jobs? 
- Basic hardware terms: Terminal/bash, API, SQL, Docker, IDE. 

## Motivation: Understanding the news
- There is so much information, but it's hard to know what is worth believing. To better understand the world, we collect data. And a lot of it. 
- Birdwatch example: misinformation - it's hard to know which Tweets you can trust, but we know that people react to tweets, so perhaps we can use those reactions to figure out whether a Tweet is trustworthy or not. We use raters and notes - how to know which notes are reliable? 
- - Looking at the matrix of notes and raters, and creating a note quality score. 

# Chapter 2: The Tools you need
- Julia programming (loops, types, broadcasting, regex, CSV, DataFrames, Functions, Packages, compilation and speed). 
- SQL (select, group by, where, join)
- Bash (cd, ls, mv, ssh, pip)
- Docker (build, run, push)
- Which IDE you need (VSCODE)

# Chapter 3: Seeing data 
- Loading a csv and looking at key observations
- Plotting w Gadfly

# Chapter 4: Statistical Significance 
- mean, variance, differences in means, t-tests, correlation, causal inference

# Chapter 5:
