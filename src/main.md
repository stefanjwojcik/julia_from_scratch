## Table of Contents
1. [Introduction](#introduction)
2. [Discovering Gradients](#discovering-gradients)

Core ideas behind gradient descent: 
- Every pattern of data is some kind of function.
- we don't know the function that generated the data, but we can try to approximate it with a function that we do know. We call this function a model.
- Gredient descent is key to being able to fit a model to data.
- The gradient is the direction of steepest ascent in a function.
- Let's imagine a function that has a single input and a single output.
